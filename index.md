*Flatness* is a research project featuring contributions by artists & writers engaging in ideas around the screen-based image & immaterial culture after the internet. This website tests the possibilities & limitations of the web as a creative site & space for viewing.

*Flatness* extends from the artists’ moving image programme ‘Flatness: Cinema after the Internet’ curated by Shama Khanna,  Ed Atkins, Anthea Hamilton & Oliver Laric at the Oberhausen International Short Film Festival 2013.
